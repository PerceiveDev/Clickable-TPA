# Clickable-TPA

This plugin hooks into any `/tpa` or `/tpahere` command and adds a configurable message with clickable *Accept* and *Deny* buttons.

To set this up just edit the config so the message fits with the color scheme of your `/tpa` plugin and change the permissions to the ones that your plugin uses.

[By default this is set up to work with a plain (default configuration) Essentials installation.](https://github.com/PerceiveDev/Clickable-TPA/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml)
